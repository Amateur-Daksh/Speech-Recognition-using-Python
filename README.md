# Speech Recognition System

This project demonstrates a simple speech recognition system using Python's `SpeechRecognition` library. It records your voice input via a microphone, recognizes the speech using Google's speech recognition service, and saves the recorded audio in a `.wav` file.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure to install the following dependencies:

- `SpeechRecognition`
- `PyAudio`
- `setuptools` (for `distutils`)

### Installation Steps

1. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   pip install PyAudio
   pip install setuptools
   ```

   > **Note:** You may encounter issues installing PyAudio on some systems. If so, please refer to the [PyAudio installation guide](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads) for platform-specific instructions.

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python speechtest.py
   ```

## How it Works

1. The program adjusts for ambient noise using the `adjust_for_ambient_noise()` function.
2. It listens for audio input from your microphone.
3. The recorded audio is sent to Google's speech recognition service to convert speech to text.
4. The recognized text is printed on the console.
5. The recorded audio is saved as `recorded.wav`.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Please say something
Recognizing Now ....
You have said 
Hello, world!
Audio Recorded Successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

- **PyAudio Installation Issues:** On some platforms (like Windows), you might need to install PyAudio using precompiled binaries. You can download them from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio) and install using pip.

- **Network Connection:** Since this script uses Google's speech recognition API, it requires an active internet connection.
